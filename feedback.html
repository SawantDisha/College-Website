      <h3>Asha Ma'am</h3>
      <p>It was an honor and privilege to have been blessed enough to have a teacher like you... you're so free spirited ma'am.. in the toughest situations you manage to keep your calm.. you're so dignified and professionalism pours out everytime you carry out a task... I feel blessed to have experienced all of that... when I was in 2nd year and asked my seniors about the faculty of 3rd they did assure me that I'm going to have a fantastic time.. because the teachers of the computer department are top notch and among them all you're the best one... after learning in your guidance I really feel that the seniors were absolutely right. Thank you for making a healthy and happy space maam for us student. Your zeal inspires us to do better. Thanks a lot🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️</p>

      <p>🌸🌸 गुरुत्व - ममत्व  समत्व 🌸🌸
Nobody influences a child's life more than a mother. On the same note, the status of a teacher is looked upon with the same sanctity, because a teacher not just directs the path of life for one child, she does it for an entire class of students. Thank you Hema ma'am for providing us with that sense of self belonging. Thank you for breaking all the barriers and creating a space of comfort of us where we can truly learn! I must say ma'am Learning has been a pleasure under your guidance. A very happy teacher's day to you! ❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻</p>

Admist all the crisis, when every single thing was at hault, you made sure that our learning doesn't stop. From learning to work with the technology overnight, to making ppts and notes for making things easy for students, to adapting to the new way of teaching or to conduct back to back lectures for hours in front of monotonous screens that only flash a few names and ids... you came a long way. It Thank you Earesh Sir for putting in such commendable efforts for us. A very happy teacher's day to you!!

Teachers are just like god which gives us knowledge, blessings and teaches us many things. One of the best teachers of PVPPCOE college, in short aryabhatta our college mrs smita mam was the best maths teacher have seen in my life. She taught maths so easily covered every sum and made sure that everyone understood each and every concept of the module.She is also very friendly in nature and also gave morale support to us. I would like to thank mrs. Smita mam on occasion of teacher's day without her passing maths exams was near to impossible and would like to dedicate one line about all teachers, ' Teachers are like candles, they burn themselves to enlighten the path of students! - Thank u and happy teachers day
